# GSoC2016
This repository contains the work I did for Google Summer of Code 2016 project.

* In Commits.md I list of all patches I contributed to the LLVM repository during the summer
* Final project report can be found in writeup.pdf. It contains high-level descriptions of the work as well as some evaluation numbers.
* Latex sources for my report are put under the tex subdirectory. To compile the report, simply cd into that directory and execute <tt>compile.sh</tt>
